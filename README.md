# canvas_utils

I have a [canvas module](https://github.com/lahvak/canvas_scripts) that I use
to access the learning management system our college uses. It contains general
purpose functions to communicate with the canvas server.

This repo contains more specific scripts that I wrote to fit my own workflow.
The are likely not going to be directly usable for other instructors, but they
can serve as an example of what can be done with my canvas module.
